## Note
- Architecture implemented with proper file structuring
- UI and logic implemented (no storing of values for now - but can be)
- Some other nice features implemented: 
  - Help icon
  - See all transactions in a nice table
  - Pagination to view each transaction
  - Progress indicator
  - Notification manageer
  - Preview selected labels
  - Remove assigned label
  - export functionality, add custom label
- Tried my best to not use external libraries instead make an in-house entity-recognizer
- Built with Next.js, React, Redux + Redux Toolkit, styled with SASS.
